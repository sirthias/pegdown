# Wikilinks

Wikilinks are simple URIs like [[Autolinks]],
which will be converted by pegdown.

Another example provides a separate link text [[page name|page link text]],
which will be converted by pegdown.

Another example with spaces: [[Special Chars]],
with square brackets: [[[Square]Brackets]].

The following links should work just normally:

* [example](http://example)
* [ex@mple](http://example)
* [example://](http://example)
