# Special character handling

Quote from <http://henkelmann.eu/2011/01/06/actuarius_release_note> 

Better handling of escapes than PegDown: PegDown does not escape 
special HTML characters like <, >, &, " and ' in normal text paragraphs, just in code blocks.

Maybe if>they are&not "stand-alone"?    
    
Well, I don't think so :)
(at least not as of **pegdown 0.9.2**!)
